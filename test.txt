Hi, my name is Jarne and I am programming a TokenStream. I have a problem with the TokenStream. I have a TokenStream that reads a file and returns the tokens. The problem is that the TokenStream reads the file and returns the tokens, but it does not return the tokens in the correct order. I have tried to fix the problem, but I have not been able to fix it. I have attached the code for the TokenStream. Can you please help me fix the problem? Thank you.
